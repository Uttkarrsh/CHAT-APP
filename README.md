# MERN CHAT-APPLICATION
The MERN stack chat application was created to facilitate seamless communication and image sharing between users, while 
also providing real-time information about online status. It incorporates the powerful technologies of MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, 
and Node.js to deliver a comprehensive chatting experience.
With this application, users can engage in conversations and exchange messages effortlessly. The chat interface, built using React.js, ensures a dynamic and interactive user experience. Messages are displayed in real-time, instantly appearing as they are sent, fostering smooth and fluid conversations.
